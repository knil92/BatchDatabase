# BatchDatabase
This file is something that me and friend created when we was in sixth form. Its basically a way of using batch files to store data and have a simple database like application that doesnt use sql or any other database engine. "Database" entries are stored in plain text which also allows for easier editing, and all entries are recorded in a csv file in case you feel the need to edit or filter in excel
