# BatchDatabase
This file is something that me and a friend created when we was in sixth form. Its basically a way of using batch files to store data and have a simple database like application that doesnt use sql or any other database engine. "Database" entries are stored in plain text which also allows for easier editing, and all entries are recorded in a csv file in case you feel the need to edit or filter in excel.

If you would like something similar or want options changing in the program, please feel free to open up a new issue and I will be more than happy to provide a customised version.

To use this just run the main.exe and follow the instructions on screen. 

The first menu has two option, just type 1 or 2 for which ever one you want to do, and press enter.

adding a school - when adding a school typing the details and pressing enter will move on to the next section

Viewing schools - once you have added a few schools, you can view them. from the main menu, type 1 and press enter, and it will bring up a list of the schools you have added and when they was added. There will also be a 4 digit number next to each school. Type this unique 4 digit number to view more details about the school, or you can type edit to go to the edit menu and you can type the 4 digit number to edit school details, or you can type back, to go back to the main menu.

Main.exe creates a few files that it uses to store information in the same directory that it's in, so I advise putting the main.exe in its own dedicated folder.
